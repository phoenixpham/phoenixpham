I'm Phoenix from Berkeley, California, and I do content regarding AI/ML. I am currently a machine learning engineer, as well as a current student at UC Berkeley who is passionate about delving in and learning more about the field and how can be incorporated into things like medicine, finance, mathematics, art, and physics. More on the theoretical side with topics like optimization, complexity theory, P=NP.
