### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phoenix from Berkeley, California, and I do content regarding AI/ML. I am currently a machine learning engineer, as well as a current student at UC Berkeley who is passionate about delving in and learning more about the field and how can be incorporated into things like medicine, finance, art, and physics.
